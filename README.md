This is a starter template for [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) projects.

## How to use this template

*This template does not work on its own*. The shared files for each starter are found in the [ionic2-app-base repo](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base).

To use this template, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy the files from this repository into the [Starter App Base](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base).

### With the Ionic CLI:

Take the name after `ionic2-starter-`, and that is the name of the template to be used when using the `ionic start` command below:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
$ ionic start mySideMenu sidemenu
```

Then, to run it, cd into `mySideMenu` and run:

```bash
$ ionic cordova platform add ios
$ ionic cordova run ios
```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac.


### Tabs Module

On the following d.ts files, certain information has been commented out to 
disregard the error messages, temporarily:

In file "node_modules/ionic-angular/navigation/nav-controller-base.d.ts" on line 20 /*implements NavController*/ has been commented out.
Example: export declare class NavControllerBase extends Ion implements NavController.
